      "After university, I got a graduate job and it wasn’t rewarding compared to the prospects StackwisR suggested to me for a career path in Analytics. After doing some research, I signed up for the courses, finished them, and got myself a new job in IT. It’s that simple and straightforward, to be honest. From my perspective it was perfect.",
